# this works:
  for (i = 1
       y = 1;
       i .le. 10;
       i = i + 1
       y = y + 1)
    write sys$output "i: ", i, "y: ", y

# this doesn't:
  for (i = 1, y = 1;
       i .le. 10;
       i = i + 1, y = y + 1)
    write sys$output "i: ", i, "y: ", y

# The latter would require understanding DCL syntax?  
# Why doesn't parser.c:initialize() count parens?
