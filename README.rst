TKB's collection of tools
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

This is a collection of tools, useful programs and scripts, that I've
gathered or written over the years.  Some of them are currently
relevant, others are abandoned or outdated.


If you don't ``git clone ${URL} --recursive`` this repo, you'll need
to do ``git submodule update --init`` to get `bats
<https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core>`_ (Bash Automated Testing
System), which is used for testing the tree different implementations
of **modpath**, which is done by running ``test/modpath.sh" in the
root directory of this repository.
